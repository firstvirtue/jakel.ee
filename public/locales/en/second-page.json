      "p01": "A unique feature of the development was the seamless page transition between the main page and the business introduction page, which is the main page. Because it had to be processed on top of the backend legacy Spring boot, the SPA framework could not be used, and only state management was done with React and processed through the history API's pushState and popstate event listener.",
      "p02": "There was an entry point page like the gate for business introduction details, and a commonly used background image was overlaid. I created an animation by masking the overlapping images, and there was no problem on the desktop, but the page kept crashing on mobile.",
      "p03": "I eventually solved the problem by handling display: none for the parts that didn't apply, but it was a frustrating moment when a fatal error occurred that caused the page to crash. I once again confirmed that mobile devices are very sensitive to rendering optimization."

      "h03": "Product component/template",
      "p07": "Another key feature, componentization/templating of product pages, also benefited from React's strong structural capabilities. I created about 20 components according to the previous screen design/design components and then combined them and rendered them according to the data and product type."

      "p03": "It was a fruitful project that allowed us to apply quite a variety of 3D technologies and UI techniques, such as split loading of assets, view switching, lighting, animation, and sprite processing, beyond point clicking and UI integration!"

UI development External human resources team building and training. Aside from the awards, it was a project that achieved great results, including practical experience with WebGL.",
      "p05": "During operation, there was a CDN performance issue, which caused major problems for pages that used image sequences. CDN resource loading performance is a problem that cannot be solved in the frontend, but I came up with the idea to split the loading and treat it as complete when only 40% is loaded, and buy time for the rest to load while the user scrolls down. For the remaining 60%, the loading order was deemed important, so load promises were processed synchronously using a generator."

      "p02": "Since it was not a personal project, I checked the feasibility of the shader effect. After sharing it with the designer/planner, I received feedback that it would be a good idea to try it.",
      "p03": "I had a hard time with the layout due to the layout being tilted by about 20 degrees rather than the shader and distortion effects.",
      "p04": "It was not easy to move parts that would have been easy with an HTML structure to WebGL space, but I created a layout in HTML, imported it, converted it to the WebGL coordinate system, and placed card objects.",
      "p05": "When going to List - Details, calculating the card rotation was more difficult than I thought. Since the slanted part is based on the card list, the coordinates/tilt of the card and parent containers had to be taken into account for it to work as intended.",
      "p06": "As expected, going back from the details to the list was not easy. I had a hard time because the values I had to remember were very complicated. When the last algorithm was solved and everything was resolved, I was so happy that even though it was 3 a.m., I didn't immediately catch a taxi to go home and I remember dancing and walking along the Gyeongui Line forest path front of the office. :)"

      "p01": "In 2021, Kia Motors changed its name to Kia and began a large-scale relaunch of the brand, including changes to CI and BI. During the materialization phase, a showcase website that dynamically displays content emerged as a requirement.",

      "h02": "Particle Interaction",
      "p03": "When the event time comes and the content switches to a showcase, the circular object shows exploding particle motion. The motion of the circular object disappearing into particles meant that the circular object surrounding the existing Kia logo disappeared and a new logo was created. (Of course, that was not my intention.)",
      "p04": "Particle interaction is implemented with the canvas element. After testing to ensure comfortable motion even on older devices, the number of particles was set at 2000. When the time is up, they are randomly generated within a set range and then spread and disappear through simple physical calculations.",
      "p05": "Within the rendering loop, each particle has an each acceleration and mass for uniform rotational motion. Based on this updated value, the particles move little by little using the cos and sin functions. Adding a damping constant for deceleration to the acceleration results in plausible particle movement.",
      "p06": "Since then, pages have been added according to the event schedule, and the website showing Kia's brand concept has changed. It doesn't change dynamically like the previous page, though.",
      "p07": "Although the number of pages was small, there were a lot of design elements and motions and a lot of requirements, so it was a difficult project.",
